  A css framework for my stuff.
</p>

## What is this for
This is a css framework I made to work for me. It doesn't conform to any sort of convention, just what i felt like doing.

You're free to use it. I don't really mind what anyone does with it.

## Setting up

Requirements for the compiler is any version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Extra information such as the time it took to compile will also be output.
